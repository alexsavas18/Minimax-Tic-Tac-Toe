# Minimax-Tic-Tac-Toe
#########################################################################################################
#   Description: Implemented minimax algorithm for a modified version of tic-tac-toe for my AI course.
#   This was a group project
#       - In this version, we have a 5 x 6 board, and the winning condition is getting 4 in a row
#       either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
#       - We were told that there were 2 computer players, with player 1 (X) looking ahead 2 moves and
#       player 2 (O) looking 4 moves ahead (2 moves per player)
#       - Each player uses the minimax function to maximize the current player's chances of winning,
#       assuming the other player will try to minimize the current player's chances
#       - The time for each move and the nodes generated before the move was made are provided in the
#       output
